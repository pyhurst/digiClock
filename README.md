# digiClock

    This was my first complete Javascipt project that I ever deployed before I started a coding bootcamp. It has a digital clock for military time and a 12 hour clock.  The heading switches greetings and colors depending on the time of day.  It also has tracker, counting the days from which I first started to learn Javascript.
